    "text": "Por su complejidad, el análisis de las colaboraciones academia-industria me ha llevado a la necesidad de codificar mi propia cosmovisión. La misma está marcada por todo lo que he vivido a lo largo mi propia experiencia personal, al igual que la de cada individuo. Pero en los últimos años, gracias a tener que enfrentarme con el desgastante viaje de escribir una tesis doctoral, he podido darle bastante forma a mi manera de pensar e interpretar los fenómenos.\nMuchas entradas estarán marcadas por la frustración que surge al escribir una tesis (perdón por eso). Igualmente intentaré también reflejar mi entusiasmo por la investigación en cada post.\nEl hilo conductor de mis posteos será, justamente, la investigación. Al menos en un principio. Y estáran centrados en todos los procesos humanos, más de carácter especulativos, que rodean a la investigación científica.\nMi bases cosmológicas:\nAlgunos puntos que considero importante transmitirles para acercarlos a mi manera de pensar:\nTiendo a pensar los procesos físicos en términos informacionales. Concibo la infinidad del universo como flujos constantes de información. La teoría de información de Shannon, la mecánica estádistica, y la idea de entropía son facinantes.\nAbrazo la complejidad y la emergencia. Considero que los procesos que acontecen son necesariamente inciertos pero influenciables.\nA consequencia de lo de influenciables, adhiero al deseo y capacidad de transformación que profesa el pragmatismo.\nCreo que la educación y el aprendizaje son el mejor camino para desarrollar capacidades de transformación en entornos sociales.\nLa educación y el aprendizaje son procesos transcendentales para la producción social de conocimiento, el conocimiento entendido como expresión de información con particular valor transformativo.\nEstos 5 principios, que combinan diversos aspectos cosmológicos, ontológicos y epistemológicos, hacen que mi interpretación del mundo sea de cierta manera. Mi interpretación del mundo me obliga a pensar formas de producción de conocimiento que permitan transformar ese mundo a partir de objetivos planeteados.\nDado que no hay mejor herramienta que la teoría, en este espacio virtual compartiré elementos que hacen a mi conceptualización o esquema teórico acerca de la producción social del conocimiento.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{hulskamp2023,\n  author = {Hulskamp, Ian},\n  title = {My {Cosmological} {Principles}},\n  date = {2023-10-28},\n  url = {https://ihulsk.github.io/posts/20231027-ispaceBasics/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHulskamp, Ian. 2023. “My Cosmological Principles.” October\n28, 2023. https://ihulsk.github.io/posts/20231027-ispaceBasics/."

Here, I provide a brief listing of the most pertinent skills that I’ve recently applied and which could be valuable for organizations in diverse fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ability to accurately identify and quantify patterns in various contexts through mathematical precision is crucial due to its significant relevance and transformative potential.\n\n\n\n📌 Statistical analysis.\n\n\nMy relationship with statistics dates back more than 10 years, starting from my first class at the University of Buenos Aires. Beyond my conceptual interest and analysis in research environments, I applied my knowledge during my time at CEPAL, where I contributed to the development of a Consumer Price Index (CPI) and other economic indicators in collaboration with Argentine government organizations.\nMore recently, as part of my doctoral thesis, I worked on models for categorical, binomial, and multinomial variables to analyze data from online surveys, which I not only analyzed but also designed and distributed using Qualtrics. The final analysis in the thesis utilized a complex version of the proportional odds model (McCullagh 1980), which allows representing ordinal categorical variables (such as Likert scale) as dependent variables.

This allowed me to explore collaborations in the academic sphere and practice network analysis. For instance, I’ve been able to depict the evolution of collaborations in academic publications among various organizations in the city of Bariloche, Argentina.

While my experience in this field is more limited, I have discovered their great potential in providing detailed insights and contextual information.\n\n\n\n📌 Interviews and case studies.\n\n\nI had conducted interviews for my master’s thesis, and more recently, for my doctoral thesis, I analyzed 26 interviews using Atlas.ti. The preparation of interviews, contacting interviewees, conducting the interviews, and transcription are essential parts of this process (Rubin and Rubin 2011; Kvale 1994). For the analysis, I employed thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke 2006), based on a list of a priori codes, which I later updated with emerging themes. Analyzing interviews can be a demanding task, but it provides valuable insights from multiple individuals with direct experience in the subject of study. Below is a screenshot of the thematic analysis process in Atlas.ti. In the future, I am excited about the prospect of conducting focus groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had my first experience with mixed methods during my doctoral thesis, following the guidance of Creswell and Clark (2017) and Tashakkori, Teddlie, and Teddlie (1998). Despite their complexity in design and implementation, mixed methods offer an alternative that allows us to combine the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative approaches, and even incorporate other methodologies and theoretical frameworks.\n\n\n\n📌 Quantitative and qualitative data integration.\n\n\nIn my case, I adapted and implemented an “explanatory sequential case study design”. Starting with the selection of a specific case study, this design initiates with a quantitative phase to identify aggregated behavioral patterns. The analysis of these results then guides the subsequent qualitative phase, aimed at achieving a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the aggregated patterns. Finally, the results from both phases are integrated, providing a more comprehensive outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to this list of technical skills, I have also developed other social competencies that are essential for achieving objectives, whether individually or collectively. These “soft skills” are associated with communication and personality traits that facilitate interpersonal relationships and intelligent navigation of one’s environment. Here is a brief list enumerating the main aptitudes I continuously work on and consider valuable for my professional ecosystem:\n\n\n📌 Complex Problem Solving:\n\nI’m passionate about tackling complex issues and devising concrete solutions that avoid falling into simplistic and reductionist proposals. With a proactive and open-minded attitude, I seek to design sophisticated, “out-of-the-box” solutions that not only consider the parts of a process but also their connections and interdependencies. In the design and implementation of my doctoral thesis, I faced all sorts of challenges (methodological, scheduling, resource limitations) that I could address and frame to provide an integrated response from a complex perspective.\n\n\n\n📌 Target Communication:\n\nEffective communication is crucial in my professional approach. I adjust technical language to understandable terms and adapt the message format according to the context and the recipient. This has been essential in my role as an intermediary between academia and industry.\n\n\n\n📌 Collaborative and Independent Work Balance:\n\nConceiving and carrying out a research project from start to finish has taught me to work autonomously. However, at the same time, being part of a research group and participating in multiple conferences have shown me the value of sharing and actively collaborating to achieve collective goals. Collaboration is key to enhancing individual skills and achieving better collective results.\n\n\n\n📌 Resilience and Adaptability:\n\nI’m excited by the continuous evolution of events and technology. I believe that challenges represent growth opportunities, for which it is necessary to embrace change and quickly incorporate new tools, methods, and work modalities. Whether through self-learning or thanks to the training offered by the organizations I’ve been a part of, I always take the initiative to master new tools and make the most of their adaptation to the needs and context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📌 Pandoc / Markdown\n📌 Prompt Engineering\n📌 Decidim\n📌 Other software and languages I’ve used: Microsoft Office, Zettlr, Stata, REDATAM, QGIS, Gephi, Freeplane, Zotero, \\(LaTeX\\), Python, Java."

If you’d like to see more comprehensive results, you can watch my presentation at the Networks 2021: Joint Sunbelt & NetSci Conference here.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidygeocoder)\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(mapdata)\nlibrary(geosphere)\nlibrary(geodist)\nlibrary(\"animation\") \n\n#### ILLUSTRATION CODE EXCERPTS FOR GIFS CREATION #### \n\n## GRAPH A (left) ----\n\n# source: https://kateto.net/network-visualization\nlibrary(\"igraph\")\nlocal_g &lt;- list()\nlocal_comp &lt;- list()\nsaveGIF({\nfor (i in loop.vector) {\n  vert &lt;- V(g_list[[i]])[which(V(g_list[[i]])$bariloche == 1 | V(g_list[[i]])$bariloche == 2)]\n  #get edges connected to selected nodes: https://igraph.org/r/doc/incident_edges.html\n  edg &lt;- incident_edges(g_list[[i]], vert, \"all\")\n  local &lt;- ego(g_list[[i]], order = 1, nodes = vert, mode = \"all\")\n  local_g[[i]] &lt;- igraph::subgraph.edges(g_list[[i]], eids = unlist(edg)) \n  local_comp[[i]] &lt;- decompose(local_g[[i]])\n  V(local_comp[[i]][[1]])$deg &lt;- degree(local_comp[[i]][[1]])\n  E(local_comp[[i]][[1]])$width &lt;- 12*E(local_comp[[i]][[1]])$weight/max(E(local_comp[[i]][[1]])$weight)\n  l = layout_with_fr(local_comp[[i]][[1]])\n  plot(local_comp[[i]][[1]], \n       vertex.size = 1+V(local_comp[[i]][[1]])$deg/max(V(local_comp[[i]][[1]])$deg)*10, vertex.label = \"\", \n       edge.width = E(local_comp[[i]][[1]])$width,\n       layout = l, \n       main = paste0(\"Bariloche's academic organization\",\"\\n\", \"ego network (largest component)\" ,\"\\n\",names(Mslice)[i])\n       )\n}\n},interval = .8, movie.name = \"bch_institutional_animation.gif\")\n\n\n#### GRAPH B (right) ----\n\ng &lt;- g_list[[i]]\n\n# Join features\ng &lt;- contract(g,\n         factor(V(g)$name),\n         vertex.attr.comb = list(name = \"first\", group = \"mean\", docs = \"max\", \"random\"))\n# attributes were merged: docs max as most of interactions are shared\ng &lt;- simplify(g, remove.loops=T, remove.multiple = T, edge.attr.comb =  list(weight = \"max\"))\n\n# generate data frames of organizations and collaborations\nun_geo_data = igraph::as_data_frame(g, what = 'both')  # affiliation network from bibliometrix as data frame\n\norgs &lt;- un_geo_data$vertices %&gt;% \n  mutate(lat = as.numeric(lat),\n         long = as.numeric(long))\n\n# Keep collaborations only with egos from BCH\nun_geo_data$edges$width &lt;- NULL\ncollabs &lt;- as_tibble(un_geo_data$edges) %&gt;% \n  filter(from %in% vert$name | to %in% vert$name) \n\n# World Map (low quality, should be improved)\nmap(\"world\", col = \"grey20\", fill = T, bg = \"black\", lwd = 0.1)\ntitle(paste(unique(orgs$year)), col.main = \"lightgrey\")\n#plot(gadm, col = myColours, border = 'grey')\n\npoints(x = orgs$long, y=orgs$lat, cex = .04+orgs$docs/max(orgs$docs), col = \"yellow\")\n\nfor(j in 1:nrow(collabs)) {\n    node1 &lt;- orgs[orgs$name == collabs[j,]$from,]\n    node2 &lt;- orgs[orgs$name == collabs[j,]$to,]\n    if (!is.na(node1$lat) & !is.na(node2$lat) & node1$lat != node2$lat)\n      {\n    arc &lt;- gcIntermediate(c(node1[1,]$long, node1[1,]$lat), \n                           c(node2[1,]$long, node2[1,]$lat), \n                           n=30, addStartEnd=TRUE, breakAtDateLine = T, sp=T)\n    edge.ind &lt;- 1# round(60*collabs[j,]$weight / max(collabs$weight))\n    \n    lines(arc, col=edge.col[edge.ind], lwd=edge.ind/5)\n\n    }\n}\n}\n},interval = .5, movie.name = \"bchDynamicInfoMap.gif\")\n\n detach('package:animation')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the quantitative approach, I have also worked with qualitative methods. While my experience in this field is more limited, I have discovered their great potential in providing detailed insights and contextual information.\n\n\n\n📌 Interviews and case studies.\n\n\nI had conducted interviews for my master’s thesis, and more recently, for my doctoral thesis, I analyzed 26 interviews using Atlas.ti. The preparation of interviews, contacting interviewees, conducting the interviews, and transcription are essential parts of this process (Rubin and Rubin 2011; Kvale 1994). For the analysis, I employed thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke 2006), based on a list of a priori codes, which I later updated with emerging themes. Analyzing interviews can be a demanding task, but it provides valuable insights from multiple individuals with direct experience in the subject of study. Below is a screenshot of the thematic analysis process in Atlas.ti. In the future, I am excited about the prospect of conducting focus groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had my first experience with mixed methods during my doctoral thesis, following the guidance of Creswell and Clark (2017) and Tashakkori, Teddlie, and Teddlie (1998). Despite their complexity in design and implementation, mixed methods offer an alternative that allows us to combine the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative approaches, and even incorporate other methodologies and theoretical frameworks.\n\n\n\n📌 Quantitative and qualitative data integration.\n\n\nIn my case, I adapted and implemented an “explanatory sequential case study design”. Starting with the selection of a specific case study, this design initiates with a quantitative phase to identify aggregated behavioral patterns. The analysis of these results then guides the subsequent qualitative phase, aimed at achieving a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the aggregated patterns. Finally, the results from both phases are integrated, providing a more comprehensive outcome."

    "text": "In addition to this list of technical skills, I have also developed other social competencies that are essential for achieving objectives, whether individually or collectively. These “soft skills” are associated with communication and personality traits that facilitate interpersonal relationships and intelligent navigation of one’s environment. Here is a brief list enumerating the main aptitudes I continuously work on and consider valuable for my professional ecosystem:\n\n\n📌 Complex Problem Solving:\n\nI’m passionate about tackling complex issues and devising concrete solutions that avoid falling into simplistic and reductionist proposals. With a proactive and open-minded attitude, I seek to design sophisticated, “out-of-the-box” solutions that not only consider the parts of a process but also their connections and interdependencies. In the design and implementation of my doctoral thesis, I faced all sorts of challenges (methodological, scheduling, resource limitations) that I could address and frame to provide an integrated response from a complex perspective.\n\n\n\n📌 Target Communication:\n\nEffective communication is crucial in my professional approach. I adjust technical language to understandable terms and adapt the message format according to the context and the recipient. This has been essential in my role as an intermediary between academia and industry.\n\n\n\n📌 Collaborative and Independent Work Balance:\n\nConceiving and carrying out a research project from start to finish has taught me to work autonomously. However, at the same time, being part of a research group and participating in multiple conferences have shown me the value of sharing and actively collaborating to achieve collective goals. Collaboration is key to enhancing individual skills and achieving better collective results.\n\n\n\n📌 Resilience and Adaptability:\n\nI’m excited by the continuous evolution of events and technology. I believe that challenges represent growth opportunities, for which it is necessary to embrace change and quickly incorporate new tools, methods, and work modalities. Whether through self-learning or thanks to the training offered by the organizations I’ve been a part of, I always take the initiative to master new tools and make the most of their adaptation to the needs and context."

    "text": "Academic and Professional Interests\n\n\nIn addition to my professional skills, my career has led me to explore various areas of knowledge that have left a mark on my worldview. Here, I describe some areas that have particularly captured my attention:\n\n\nComplexity Theory and Information Theory\n\n🧩 Exploring the complexity of phenomena. 📚 Resources and enthusiasm for emergent properties, entropy (Ben-Naim 2008), the groundbreaking work of Claude Shannon (1949), and subsequent studies in various knowledge areas (e.g., Boisot and Canals 2004; Gleick 2011; Snowden 2002; Polyanskiy and Wu 2022).\n\n\n\nGraph Theory and Network Analysis\n\n🌐 Unraveling relationships beyond the actors. 🔗 Representing complexity as interconnected and interdependent systems, considering both nodes and the links that connect them (Börner, Sanyal, and Vespignani 2007; M. S. Granovetter 1973; M. Granovetter 1983; Newman 2018).\n\n\n\nEconomics, Institutions, and Culture\n\n💼 Exploring the socio-cultural foundations of economic behavior. 📖 Interdisciplinary research on how culture and institutions influence the management of resources, information, and knowledge. The list of references here is extensive, but beyond pure economics, it’s worth mentioning works in innovation systems (Cooke 2001; Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000; Lundvall 1988; Nelson and Rosenberg 1993), open innovation (Chesbrough 2003; Von Hippel 2005), commons (Allen and Potts 2016; Hess and Ostrom 2007; Kostakis, Niaros, and Giotitsas 2015; Ostrom 1990), and information economics (Boisot 1998).\n\n\n\nOrganizational Theory and Knowledge Management\n\n🏘️ Studying strategies for the collective production of knowledge 📦 Another field with a wealth of literature. Besides countless classic references (e.g., Alavi and Leidner 2001; Cetina 1999; March 1991; Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995; Polanyi 1958; Teece, Pisano, and Shuen 1997), I highlight the theoretical framework developed by Boisot (1995) for understanding information and knowledge flows in social settings: the Information Space or I-Space. Coding, abstraction, and diffusion are three key dimensions used to analyze the ongoing production of knowledge (Boisot et al. 2011).\n\n\n\nPlatforms and Digitalization\n\n🗂️ Navigating the Digital Age. 📊 Exploring the phenomenon of platforms and their widespread impact on contemporary economy. I’m particularly drawn to theoretical perspectives like Gawer (2020). Understanding how these platforms are reshaping economic and social interactions is fundamental. We’ve written something on the topic.\n\n\n\nPhilosophy: Pragmatism, Enactivism, Education, Psychology\n\n🧠 Philosophy in action. 📜 Exploring pragmatist approaches (Dewey 1923), enactivists (Varela, Thompson, and Rosch 2017), and their application in fields like education and psychology (e.g., Bereiter and Scardamalia 2014; Kress 2009; Scardamalia and Bereiter 2010).\n\n\n\nZettelkasten\n\n🗂️ Creative organization. 🤯 The Zettelkasten technique as a source of idea generation and thought organization (Ahrens 2022).\n\n\n\nLanguages\n\n🗣️ Connecting through language. 🌎 My passion for understanding cultural differences and communication patterns has inevitably led me to learn languages. In addition to my fluency in Spanish, English, Italian, and active study of Catalan, I can communicate in French. I would love to continue learning other languages.\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAhrens, Sönke. 2022. How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking.
